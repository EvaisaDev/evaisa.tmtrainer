# Install Instructions

### Manual Install

 - Press the *[Download Zip](https://github.com/EvaisaDev/evaisa.tmtrainer/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)* button
 - Extract into your noita mod folder (`C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Noita/mods/` for steam users)
 - The `init.lua` file should be 1 layer deeper than `Noita/mods/`, found in `mods/evaisa.tmtrainer/init.lua`.
 - Rename `evaisa.tmtrainer-main` to `evaisa.tmtrainer` **⚠ THE MOD WILL NOT WORK IF YOU SKIP THIS STEP. ⚠**
 - If you see any initialization errors, go through these steps again and ensure it isn't user error.

### Cloning Repository

 - If you have Github or Git on your device, then you can clone the repository directly into your noita mods folder.
 - You will not have to rename anything if you do so, and it is much easier to update the mod.
 - I suggest this method if you're good at using Git or intend on contributing to this mod.
